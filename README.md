# Breast_Cancer
# Wisonsin Breast Cancer dataset, which records clinical measurements of breast cancer tumors. Each tumer is labeled as "benign"(for harmless tumors) and "malignant"(for cancerous tumors), and the task is to predict whether a tumer is malignant based on the measurement of the tissue.
The data is Supervised which deals with classification problem.
There are 569 rows and 30 columns where the target variable is Class: Malignant and Benign
Here, I have used two models; Logistic Regression and DecisionTreeClassifier
Greater the accuracy, better the model.
